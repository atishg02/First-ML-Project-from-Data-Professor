# First-ML-Project-from-Data-Professor
This repo goes through a colab tutorial of my first ML project, which was done by Data Professor on YouTube. Here is the link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29ZQ3TDGgRQ

This tutorial was an incredibly insightful and intuitive demonstration of how to create your own ML project. Machine learning was something taught on the side in my statistics undergraduate courses, therfore, this tutorial helped me get the basics down for the actual prcoess of an ML project. It is clear how a lot of the aspects of ML can be easily reproducible for other projects, if given a cleaned dataset.
